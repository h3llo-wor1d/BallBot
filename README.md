# PROJECT MUSE - An experimental arts show, created by [Wrench](https://bsky.app/profile/wrench.bsky.social)
> This project has been programmed miticulously from source for 2 years and maintainted by one person, so don't cry if the code is bad!

## What was Project Muse?
Project Muse was a bi-weekly live interview show that started in October 2022, in which participants would be invited into a locked Discord server where they would 
register themselves for the chance to get free stream music made live on-stream, as well as a brief interview to introduce themselves to our audience.

The show itself sounds simple, but the technology behind it was overly complicated! I had to break Discord TOS multiple times throughout (which i will not be sharing the code for) to get registrants' pronouns and linked social medias to enable automatic shoutouts and our custom overlay systems. 

This codebase is for the latest iteration of BallBot, which ran entirely on AWS. In this iteration, participants would register through a custom React.JS website with links for custom music AND one custom emote, made in an hour or less on-stream. This was the most technical iteration of the app, as it included all of the custom overlays.
> The frontend of projectmuse.live will be released soon for further information.

## Why is this open-source now?
I was fighting with myself on whether or not I wanted the project to be free or paid. Ultimately, I have decided for multiple reasons that I will be making this codebase open-source for the public to adapt into their own custom shows.
> I will do my absolute **best** to document the codebase, but I cannot get to it all in one sitting!

## How should I credit you?
If you use the BallBot framework, I ask that you credit me (duh.)
